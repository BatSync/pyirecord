# PyRecord

A minimal library aiming to offer a similar interface to [pyinaturalist](https://pyinaturalist.readthedocs.io/) but for the UK's [iRecord](https://irecord.org.uk) national observatory.

Very much a work in progress - at the moment all we can do is get a JWT token, can't yet see how to request projects and records.
